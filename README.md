# my-spotify-app
A Python app made using Kivy as its GUI framework, wherein it uses the Spotify API to:
    1. Display Spotify profile
    2. Search on Spotify
    3. Show playlists
    4. Make playlists
    5. Access the page of a song, album, etc.

## Installation
As of the moment, you will not be able to access the software properly because the application is still in development mode.

## Reasoning for Project
I am doing this in order to deepen my understanding with working with APIs, with my freshman programming project being a Reddit client, and I felt particularly inspired to continue working with them.

## Possible Features to be Added
1. Song player in the app
2. Remove items in playlist
