# my-spotify-app

Will be done using Spotify API and Python, with Flet as the GUI framework.

# Reasoning for Project
I am doing this in order to deepen my understanding with working with APIs, with my freshman programming project being a Reddit client, and I felt particularly inspired to continue working with them.
Flet will be used as it is the GUI framework wherein I am most familiar with working in, especially in terms of authentication, and has complete documentation.

# How to use
TBA
